# WifiBruteForcer
This repo was not successful, But i wanted to build the logic to bruteforce a wifi network. When i was testing, this had taken 4 seconds to check single attempt with one adapter. So if we need to break 8 characters password, we have to do 8^8 maximum attempts, it means much time. So i am stopping this from here. In the future, modern wifi adapters can be invented which can have concurrent 1000+ network connections. At those times, this concept can be valuable. I don't responsible for negetive activities causing by using this. This has built for learning purposes only.
